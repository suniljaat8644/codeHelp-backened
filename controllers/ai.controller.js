  IMPORTANT CONTEXT: This code is a snippet from a competitive programming platform (like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeChef). 
  DO NOT flag missing \`main\` functions, missing class definitions, or missing module imports as mistakes or syntax errors. Focus purely on the logic, time/space complexity, and algorithmic correctness of the provided function/snippet.
  
  Analyze the user's code and pinpoint the highly specific algorithmic concept, data structure mechanics, or edge case they are struggling with based on this snippet.
  
  IMPORTANT: You must return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following structure, and nothing else (no markdown wrapping, no extra text):
  {
    "mistakesAndFeedback": "Your detailed explanation of mistakes and perfections here...",
    "perfectCode": "The complete perfect code in ${language} here... (If the code is incomplete, leave this as an empty string)",
